# 🚀 Real-Time Stock Price Analytics Pipeline using Airflow, Snowflake, dbt & Superset

## ✨ Why I Built This Project

With the stock market being fast-moving and volatile, I wanted to build a **real-time analytics pipeline** that could track and visualize patterns in stock prices. As someone passionate about both finance and data engineering, I chose this project to simulate how enterprise teams build **scalable ELT systems** that power BI dashboards and drive decision-making.

This pipeline takes **raw stock data** (NVDA, MSFT), ingests it automatically using **Apache Airflow**, models it with **dbt**, stores it in **Snowflake**, and visualizes it using **Superset dashboards**.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience orchestrating automated workflows and managing data lifecycle from **API ingestion to insight delivery** — a vital skill set for roles in **Data Engineering** and **Analytics**.

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Real-time stock prices fetched every 10 minutes using Alpha Vantage API
   - Managed by **Airflow DAG 1**

2. **Data Loading**
   - Ingested into `STOCK_PRICE` table in **Snowflake**
   - Uses `MERGE` SQL for efficient upserts

3. **Data Transformation**
   - **Airflow DAG 2** runs dbt models:
     - Calculates 7-day and 30-day moving averages
     - Computes RSI (Relative Strength Index)
   - Output tables: `STOCK_ANALYTICS`, `MOVING_AVG`, `RSI_TABLE`

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Apache Superset connects to Snowflake
   - Dashboards visualize trends, RSI, and closing prices

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

This interactive Superset dashboard visualizes real-time trends in **NVIDIA (NVDA)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** stock performance using:

- **Closing Prices**
- **7 & 30-Day Moving Averages**
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**

### 👥 Designed For:
- 📈 **Investors & Traders** – to make informed buy/sell decisions based on momentum
- 📉 **Technical Analysts** – to spot reversal points using RSI
- 📊 **Financial Analysts** – to identify price stability and short-term trends

### 📂 Dataset Sources:
- Daily OHLC stock prices for NVDA and MSFT
- Calculated RSI and moving averages using dbt models

This dashboard focuses on short-term performance analysis for NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) by offering a dynamic view of:

📈 Closing Price Trends (e.g., NVDA from Sep–Nov)
📊 Side-by-Side Monthly Comparison of NVDA and MSFT
📅 7-Day Price History for rapid short-term analysis

🔍 Use Cases:
Track short-term momentum
Compare performance across specific dates
Assess immediate price fluctuations
